# A bit about me

## Things I like

Spending evenings and weekends with my family, finding new things to do and new places to go.

I’m into my Stoic philosophy.

Exploring generally the older ideas in software programming and architecture as I find they are often the best (many a thing has been seen and done before).

Thinking things through in my own time, I do not think that a spur of the moment debate is ever really the time to solve a problem. Saying that I am prepared to challenge the established thinking on things when I believe I have a valid case.

Doing a thing (just one at a time) and doing it well.

Lisp, Clojure, privacy, ethics, decentralisation (no that does not mean Blockchain or crypto), API design, REST and HATEOAS.

I am a fan of Open Source.

I think that some of the ’Agile’ movement is very good, particularly the early and continuous delivery of valuable software, and response to change.

I love reading, all sorts of books, especially SCI-FI - Dune and the Night’s Dawn Trilogy may be the best books ever written.

Red wine, typically Italian, Spanish or French.

Sharing a curry and some beer regularly with a couple of friends who are fellow Open Source Software Engineers (or I did pre Covid-19), some of our little projects are over at [VoxMachina](http://voxmachina.org/).

Keeping fit by challenging gravity with my own bodyweight, to do this I need a floor, a pull up bar and some parallettes. Yoga and hand-balancing.

Gaming, Playstation, Switch and PC - RTS/RPG and others.

Podcasts - mostly from [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm/).

## Things I don't like

Naughty Tech companies.

Solutionising and design by committee where nobody really knows or cares what the customer needs or wants.

I strongly dislike the dogma and ’policy’ elements that some interpretations of ’Agile’ yield.

’All’ of something or ’None’ of something opinions or attitudes, inevitably the truth is that it is somewhere in the middle.

Covid-19.

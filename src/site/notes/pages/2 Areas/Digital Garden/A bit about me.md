# A bit about me
## Things I like
Spending evenings and weekends with my family, finding new things to do and new places to go.

I’m into my Stoic philosophy.

Exploring generally the older ideas in software programming and architecture as I find they are often the best (many a thing has been seen and done before).

Thinking things through in my own time, I do not think that a spur of the moment debate is ever really the time to solve a problem. Saying that I am prepared to challenge the established thinking on things when I believe I have a valid case.

Doing a thing (just one at a time) and doing it well.

Lisp, Clojure, privacy, ethics, decentralisation (no that does not mean Blockchain or crypto), API design, REST and HATEOAS.

I am a fan of Open Source.

I think that some of the ’Agile’ movement is very good, particularly the early and continuous delivery of valuable software, and response to change.

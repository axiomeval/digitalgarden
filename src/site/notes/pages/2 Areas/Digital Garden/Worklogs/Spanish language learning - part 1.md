# Spanish language learning - part 1

Published: 2022-12-18

## What is the problem this solves?

- Learning languages is hard - especially when you don't have much time
- Learning languages can be boring if you go about it the wrong way
- I'm not convinced that verb tables and declensions and learning by rote are something you can take anywhere with you as a set of portable learning techniques


## What is this solution?

- Use memory techniques; memory palace, visual encoding etc to make your tools for learning portable
- Make sure everything is fun, visual, amusing - choose the right course(s), book(s) and use a mix of media
- Figure out tools that let you both create and practice in a fun and visual

## An example
